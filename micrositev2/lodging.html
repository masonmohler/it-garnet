        <h2>Full-service Cabins</h2>
        <p>
          The full-service cabins at Devil's Den State Parks have all the
          amenities guests need for a relaxing getaway. Although many of the
          cabins were built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps,
          they are updated with modern amenities including satellite television,
          heat, and air conditioning, full kitchens with cookware and
          dinnerware. Linens are provided in these cabins. Outdoor seating is
          also provided. Cabins 2, 3, 5, and 7 are dog-friendly with added fees.
          Please call the park directly for details.

        <h2>Camper Cabins</h2>
        <p>
          Camper Cabins are available as an option that is closer to the camping
          experience. These cabins sleep up to 4 people. There is no kitchen,
          bathroom, or television and guests must bring their own linens. Cabin
          guests share a family-style bathhouse which allows for full privacy in
          both bathrooms and showers. Each camper cabin has a screened porch
          with chairs, a dining table inside, and a picnic table, grill, and
          lantern hanger outside. These cabins have heat and air conditioning.
