        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>
          An Arkansas icon, this special place nestled in Lee Creek Valley was
          selected as a state park site in the 1930s. The Civilian Conservation
          Corps used native materials to build the park’s rustic-style wood and
          stone structures that mirror the surrounding natural beauty. It now
          stands as one of the most intact CCC sites in the U.S., with a legacy
          you can see in its trails and buildings like its original cabins. Some
          of the park’s unique characteristics are rock formations and caverns.
          An impressive rock dam spans Lee Creek forming Lake Devil, an 8-acre
          lake for fishing and boating with canoes and pedal boats for rent. The
          park’s hiking, backpacking, mountain bike, and horseback riding trails
          lead to the surrounding Ozark National Forest.
        </p>

          Devil’s Den includes 17 cabins with kitchens and fireplaces and 6
          camper cabins. The park also offers 135 campsites (44 Class AAA, 24
          Class D [no hookups], eight hike-in [tent only], and 42 sites with
          hookups in the horse camp that includes a bathhouse and access to the
          horse trails). The park’s cafe is open seasonally. The pool is open in
          summer only. Also on-site is a group camp, standard pavilion, store,
          and a meeting room.
