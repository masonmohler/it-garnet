            public research university in Little Rock, Arkansas. Established as
            Little Rock Junior College by the Little Rock School District in
            1927, the institution became a private four-year university under

            status in 1969 when it merged with the University of Arkansas System
            under its present name. The former campus of Little Rock Junior
            College is now (2019) the campus of Philander Smith University.
