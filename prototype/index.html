            The University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UA Little Rock) is a
            public research university in Little Rock, Arkansas. Established as
            Little Rock Junior College by the Little Rock School District in
            1927, the institution became a private four-year university under
            the name Little Rock University in 1957. It returned to public
            status in 1969 when it merged with the University of Arkansas System
            under its present name. The former campus of Little Rock Junior
            College is now (2019) the campus of Philander Smith University.

            The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities
            in the United States. It is characterized by student-run
            organizations and affiliation groups that support social, academic,
            athletic, and religious activities and interests. Some of the
            services offered by the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are
            intramural sports and fitness programs, diversity programs,
            leadership development, peer tutoring, student government
            association, student support programs including groups for
            non-traditional and first-generation students, a student-run
            newspaper, and fraternity and sorority life. The proximity of the UA
            Little Rock campus to downtown Little Rock enables students to take
            advantage of a wide array of recreational, entertainment,
            educational, internship, and employment opportunities that are not
            available anywhere else in Arkansas.[20]

              <em>University Village Apartment Complex</em>[21] on the southern
              side of campus. <strong>Six</strong> learning communities focusing

            <h3>Athletics</h3>
            <p>
              UA Little Rock's <strong>14 athletic teams</strong> are known as
              the Little Rock Trojans, with almost all teams participating in
              the Sun Belt Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt
              members that do not sponsor football (UT Arlington being the
              other); UA Little Rock last fielded a football team in 1955 when
              it was known as Little Rock Junior College. Little Rock's main
              athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center.
            </p>
            <h5>UA Little Rock offers the following sports:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Baseball</li>
              <li>Men's and Women's Basketball</li>
              <li>Men's and Women's Golf</li>
              <li>Women's Volleyball</li>
              <li>Women's Soccer</li>
              <li>Women's Swimming/Diving</li>
              <li>Men's and Women's Cross Country</li>
              <li>Men's and Women's Track and Field (Indoor and Outdoor)</li>
              <li>Men's wrestling</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Two Little Rock teams that do not compete in the Sun Belt are the
              women's swimming and diving team (Missouri Valley Conference) and
              wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt
              sponsors. Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in
              2019, and is the first Division I program in Arkansas. Little Rock
              will move to the Ohio Valley Conference for the 2022-23 season.
